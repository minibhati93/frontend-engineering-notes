# Frontend Engineering Notes

This repository contains long-form notes, experiments, and evolving thoughts
on frontend engineering, primarily focused on Angular-based UI systems.

Some of the material here later becomes blog posts.
Others remain as working notes.

This repository is intentionally **not optimized for beginners**.

## Structure
- `/concepts` — deep dives into frontend concepts and framework behavior
- `/decisions` — architectural decisions and trade-offs
- `/experiments` — notes from hands-on exploration
- `/published-posts` — finalized articles published externally

## Relationship to my blog
Posts published on Hashnode or DEV.to are curated snapshots
of the thinking captured in this repository.

The GitHub versions may:
- Contain additional context
- Include rejected alternatives
- Show evolution of understanding

## Why this exists
As systems grow, clarity becomes more valuable than speed.

This repository exists to practice:
- Clear technical reasoning
- Explicit trade-offs
- Long-term thinking in frontend engineering
